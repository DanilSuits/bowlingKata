At this point, there is a little bit of duplication.

The bigger concern is the lack of clarity; the code really isn't telling us what's going on.  What we have here is a
sketch, but no more than that.

The clarity it important -- [DRY is about knowledge](http://verraes.net/2014/08/dry-is-about-knowledge/)

 > “Don’t Repeat Yourself” was never about code. It’s about knowledge. It’s about cohesion. If two pieces of code
 represent the exact same knowledge, they will always change together. Having to change them both is risky: you might
 forget one of them. On the other hand, if two identical pieces of code represent different knowledge, they will change
 independently. De-duplicating them introduces risk, because changing the knowledge for one object, might accidentally
 change it for the other object.

This is a case where clarity gets preference over remove duplication - we need meaning to evaluate which values are
"the same".
