#Status: GREEN

The array for balls thrown was a sort of hack, and it's left me with two issues that really should be cleaned up.

The array could be used as is -- the Java language is specific about what state will be included in the array, and that
state happens to have exactly the behavior that we want.  To use that data is to rely, somewhat, on the implicit magic
of the language, and I prefer to keep things explicit.

If I explicitly set each element of the array, then I get two immediate benefits in return -- I eliminate the need for
a dummy loop variable, and I no longer need to nest the pinsKnockedDown constant within the loop.
