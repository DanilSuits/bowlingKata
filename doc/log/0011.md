#Status: GREEN

As usual, the answer is another layer of indirection.

To make it clear what's going on, in this first pass we'll just
introduce new classes without changing the test code in any way.

Neither of these names are any good - the Model wants to be Game,
or Scorer, or something along those lines, and Game wants to be
well, just about anything else.

I'm leaning on [J.B. Rainsberger](http://blog.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design)
for help here.

> Instead of agonizing over the choice of a name,
I simply pick a name, confident that I always look for
opportunities to move names towards becoming meaningful.
