# Status: GREEN

This isn't quite all the way right, although for the bowling
game kata it's pretty close.  Nonetheless, there is another
level of inception close at hand, so we might as well at
least demonstrate where that should fit.

The key requirement comes form J.B. Rainsberger, and his talk
[Integeration Tests Are A Scam](https://vimeo.com/80533536);
that requirement is echoed in the design of
[Pact](https://docs.pact.io/).  In a word: _GIVEN_.

The implied assumption of the current design is that the test
will always begin from the initial state of the system under
test.

Hey, it works for event sourcing.

But sometimes, you don't care about the entire history of the
system, and want to start from a snapshot of the current state.
In other words, you want a known good starting position.

Of course, it's the implementation that understands what it
_means_ for the system under test to be in that state.  So we
need a layer of soup to interpret between the two.

Mark Seemann touches on this in his discussion of
[DI Friendly Frameworks](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/05/19/di-friendly-framework/).
In summary, the test -- which is the client -- defines an abstract factory
interface that it will use to acquire test subjects in the required initial
state.

Which is to say, instead of restricting ourselves to test subjects that can
be instantiated using the default constructor, we restrict ourselves to test
subjects that can be instantiated by factories which in turn were loaded
from the default constructor.

Which theatens turtles all the way down, but I believe does indeed stop
recursing at this point.
