#Status: GREEN

At this point, the test has been divided into two distinct
phases.  In the top portion, we are definiting the specification
that will be used; in the bottom portion, we are actually
exercising the subject to see if it behaves correctly.

The boundary between the two is the specification itself, so
we should make that explicit.

In this refactoring, I've also re-arranged the code above
the specification boundary.  It helps to show that, in this
case, the complication is in defining the throws, rather than
the final outcome.
