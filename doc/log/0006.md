# Status: GREEN

The locality of the Game code isn't very good at this point; I'm initializing it at the top of the test, I'm querying it
at the bottom of the test, it gets modified at some arbitrary location in the middle of the test.  Yuck.

So in the interest of keeping things tidy, let's move all the of the fixed definitions to the top of the test, and all
of the Game interestions down to the bottom.
