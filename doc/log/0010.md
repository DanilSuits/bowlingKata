#Status: GREEN

There's an area of the specification verifier that doesn't quite
smell right, but I want to sneak up on it from the far side, by
asking this question -- what happens to our test when we improve
the model?

The starting state is green, so we have permission to refactor
at will.  We recognize from the domain that "score" is a first
class concept, which should be made explicit -- indeed, I
already saw confusion of multiple meaning of score when I corrupted
Uncle Bob's Game class during my bootstrap.

So we introduce a Score class, and use it in the score() method,
immediately running into a problem.  What we really want to do here
is return the Score, but in order to do that we need to start
modifying the test to keep it synchronized with the current
implementation of the model.

That's backwash.

Of course, we _can_ change the test to match; but the point of
the test is to ensure that the changes we are making preserve
the behavior we want.  We shouldn't be turning both sides of
the dial at the same time.

Looking more carefully at the _THEN_ stage of the verify()
method, there is a glimmer of a hint in the assertion, which is
that the two terms have different temporal units -- the expected
value is a representation that was specified in the past, where
the actual value is a representation that was specified in the
present.

Because we are eschewing Big Design Up Front, we don't have a
well thought out API for the specifications to enforce.  So
instead, we get an API by accident -- chosen for the convenience
of generating our specifications rather than reflecting a deep
understanding of the problem.  And that's _fine_, so long as
we don't get trapped in that choice.
