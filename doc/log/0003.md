After the previous pass, all of the integer literals had names _except_ the initial value of the dummy variable used
as a loop counter.  So I wanted to be rid of that; switching to a for-each loop drops the locally irrelevant end points.

IntStream.range() could have been a reasonable choice here, or pulling in one of the Guava libraries, but I'm reaching
for the simplest thing that could possibly work.
