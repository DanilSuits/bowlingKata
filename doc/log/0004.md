I have three literal zeros in the test at this point

 * expectedScore
 * finalScore
 * scoreForGutterBall

Is there _duplication_ here?

**expectedScore** is part of the specification; it describes what the behavior _should be_.
**finalScore** is a consequence of the implementation; it describes what the behavior _is_.

Those are clearly two separate concepts.

However, they are supposed to _match_; which is to say that they should be in agreement because they are each aligned
with some other concept.  In this case, the missing concept is that the initial score -- we expect the score to be zero,
because that's the result that you get when you start from zero and add to it a sequence of zeros.

**scoreForGutterBall** is not a duplicate, because the entire derivation is different; this score is more closely aligned
with scorePerPin (which is a rate) times pinsKnockedDown.  So we should make those ideas explicit.
