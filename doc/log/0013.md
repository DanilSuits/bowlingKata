#Status: GREEN

To properly align the dependencies, we start by introducing
a service provider interface in the test model, which defines
the contract that the adapter has to implement.

Conceptually, the specifications are locked in the past -- they
are closed.  The model is in the present, and our competitive
advantage in the cutthroat world of bowling scoring systems
derives from our ability to improve and deploy our models on
agile time scales, so the model needs to be fully open.  The
adapter in the middle is half closed; it conforms rigidly to
the api contract defined by the test, but updates its internal
details in lockstep with the surface of the model.

Along the way, we'll change the abbreviated name for the
systemUnderTest.  Maybe a more meaningful name will come
along later.
