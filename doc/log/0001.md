# Status: GREEN

A bit of a cheat; rather than starting from scratch, I've taken Uncle Bob's code from the point that he is about to
introduce a second test.

The code shown here is a port of slide 19 of [Uncle Bob's powerpoint deck](http://butunclebob.com/files/downloads/Bowling%20Game%20Kata.ppt)
with only a few minor changes.

 * I'm using org.testng:testng:6.9.9, rather than JUnit.
 * I've deliberately left the Game class within the test source, as a "non public top level class"
 * I've used IntelliJ's autocomplete functionality to create the methods needed to pass the test, and left the
 comments in place to prove it.
