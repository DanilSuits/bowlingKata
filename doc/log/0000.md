# Introduction

This is a refactoring exercise; I want to see what there is to be learned by taking one of the old TDD katas, and
attack it hard in the early going to explore some ideas that I have about the limits of refactoring, and where more
recent lessons fit in.

# Status: GREEN

No tests, but they all pass.
