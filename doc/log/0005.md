Come to think of it, the scoring tool is supposed to be responsible for scoring, not the test harness, so why on earth
are we computing a score for the gutter ball?

Answer: because I used an autogenerated function signature for Game.roll(), which lost the knowledge that the Uncle
Bob's example was tracking the number of pins knocked over.

The error does illustrate some of the benefit of using the type system to make Units explicit; but we'll leave that idea
in the bank for the moment -- maybe we aren't going to need it.

That also means that SCORE_PER_PIN isn't used anywhere, so I'll revert that change.
