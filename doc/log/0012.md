#Status: GREEN

And then a renaming.  Of course, renaming the classes does change
the implementation of the test, but in not so alarming a fashion
as changing the assertions to match the model.

There's definitely an order to the dependencies that needs to
be teased out and respected -- the model lives at the center of
the onion.  The specifications stand on their own, a bullwark
of the past.  The adapter needs to depend on both of these.

That means that the INITIAL_SCORE knowledge needs a home -- it
had lived in Game, but Game became Adapter and fell to the
bottom of the dependency graph.  Since the model and the test
need to share this knowledge, it implies some dependency
that sits above both of them -- they share a common understanding
of the rules of bowling.  So we make that concept explicit.

The test is still green, but we still have a dependency issue as
the verify() method depends on the Adapter.
