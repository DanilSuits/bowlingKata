#Status: GREEN

To make even more explicit the fact that verifying a specification
is a separate idea from composing the specification, I
introduce a new method to isolate the interaction with the game
instance.

The Given/When/Then structure of this test is a lot more
obvious when the specification clutter is removed.

You may have noticed that the refactoring is tending to focus
more on the test rig than on the bowling model -- we still have
yet to tease the notion of frames out of the model.

This is no longer an accident.
